        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>What Is Tarot?</h2>
        <p>Tarot is a deck of cards. The traditional tarot deck has 78 cards. The cards are divided up into 5 different groups. The first group is called the Major Arcana. This group contains 22 cards all depicting different pictures of life events. Everything from love and fertility, to law and order, to destruction and death is displayed in the Major Arcana. The “Majors” as they are nicknamed, are all big events that happen in life.</p>
        <p>Next we have what is called the Minor Arcana. The “Minors” as they are nicknamed, are the remaining 56 cards divided into 4 suits. Each suit has it's own purpose. There is the Suit of Cups to symbolize emotions and relationships. There is the Suit of Wands to show us our passions and creativity. Then we have the Suit of Swords that indicate communication, knowledge and discord. Lastly, we have the Suit of Pentacles, which shines light on our financial endeavors and money related issues.</p>
        <p>These 4 suits of the Minors are all little things that add to the big things (Major Arcana) in our life. Together they display an array of life's situations and can shine light on the areas we are missing out on, things that we focus on too much, or things that we are somehow completely unaware of that hinders/helps us on our journey.</p>
        <h2>What Is A Tarot Reading?</h2>
        <p>Tarot readings have different definitions from different readers. One may use tarot to heal past wounds, to predict the future or as a game. For me, when I read tarot for a client, I am working out problems for them like you would in a counseling session. We take an issue in one's life, and through the use of tarot, find new perspectives and solutions to those problems.</p>
        <p>The quarent (the person getting the reading) shuffles and chooses a specific number of cards for the reading. This practice, whether the quarent is aware of it or not, is tuning them into their own intuition. The cards that they pick for their reading hold the messages that they need to hear in order to progress through their immediate circumstances. One by one we flip the cards over and reveal the story that they hold. The cards, as explained above, can help shine light on a situation so that we are able to see other perspectives and find solutions to issues at hand. All readings are for entertainment purposes only.</p>
        <h2>How Long Does A Tarot Reading Take?</h2>
        <p>This depends on how many cards are in the reading. A 3 card reading usually takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes. A full 10 card reading takes about 45 minutes to an hour to do. The reason for this is because I take the time out to write out your reading for you and go into detail over what the reading states. I write the reading out for you so that you can take it home and review it at your convenience. Having something tangible for your time with me is also satisfying and you can always remember how it helped you!</p>
        <p>Emailed readings are also available if you wish to not participate in an in-person reading. The email readings are paid for via PayPal and will arrive in your email fully explained with a photograph of your cards within 24-48 hours from time of confirmed payment.</p>
        <h2>How Can I Schedule A Reading With You?</h2>
        <p>You can set an appointment with me either through Facebook at <a href="//www.facebook.com/tabstarot">facebook.com/tabstarot</a> or via email by sending me a message at <a href="mailto:tabstarot@yahoo.com">tabstarot@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
        <h2>Why Is There Not A Contact Phone Number For You?</h2>
        <p>I PURPOSELY do not have a business line. I do not do business over the phone. I either read in person or by email only. There are tons and tons of 1-800 tarot hotlines out there that are on call 24/7 if that's the sort of reading you desire. I am not an 'on demand' reader due to my lifestyle so this is why we schedule appointments. :-)</p>
        <h2>Where Is Your Office?</h2>
        <p>For new clients, I prefer to do readings at local cafes and coffee shops in the Austin area. When you schedule an appointment we will discuss places in the local area that are convenient to both parties and not too much out of the way for either of us. Once we establish a repoire we can discuss meeting at other locations that may be more private for better focus and more in depth discussions.</p>
        <h2>Will You Read At House Parties?</h2>
        <p>Yes, I can and will read at house parties, but the prices for these are a bit different than the one-on-one reading. Please be aware that I do not read anyone under the age of 18 or anyone who is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Please email me for more details.</p>
