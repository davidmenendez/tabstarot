        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Tabitha and I am from Austin, TX. I have been reading tarot since 2002, however, I've been reading publically since September 2015. I have an Associates in Behavioral Sciences from Concordia University. Initially I wanted to do family/couples/marriage counseling, however, financial constraints have kept me from pursuing the education I would need in order to achieve that tall order.</p>
        <p>Before, during and after college, I volunteered for SafePlace (aka The Battered Women's Shelter of Austin, TX).  I worked extensively with SafePlace for 8 years before journeying on to new things. During my time at SafePlace, I learned more about the psychological hardships of those in abusive relationships and how they can really tear down one's self esteem. This helped me understand real world applications of what I had learned in college. All the while, I was still working with tarot and learning to trust my own intuition.</p>
        <p>Now I have the ability to share my gifts with anyone who needs advice, new perspectives, ideas and different ways to approach situations. Together we study the cards in your reading and put the pieces of the puzzle together to give you more control over your life. The cards in a reading not only have their own story to tell but they talk to the cards surrounding them, making your reading truly unique and personal to your current circumstances. We will look at what is missing, what is dominant as well as how these cards talk to one another for a full picture of your life.</p>
        <p>We all have free will, and with this free will comes choices. Even not making a decision is making a decision! Due to this, all readings are fluid. They are not set in stone. So if you get a reading that is not as optimistic as you'd like, know that you have the ability to change things in your life so that it doesn't have to be that way! The tarot is simply a roadmap showing you where you are at currently, what in the past got you here and where you are going in the future should you not make any changes and keep going down the path you have already considered. The best part is, we can walk a different path at any moment in time.</p>
        <p>I find reading tarot is very spiritual and insightful. I connect with many people, who in other circumstances, I would not have the opportunity to connect with. You don't need to have a question or a specific situation in mind to get a reading. I find general readings to be more effective as they point out things we may not  have otherwise seen, however, I can specifically focus on a question or topic if you so choose. My main concern always is, "Does the reading make sense to you?". For me, the highest success is for you to walk away knowing what to do with your life and where you want to go from here. I look forward to reading your cards. :-)</p>
        <p>Love and Light,</p>
        <p>Tabitha</p>
